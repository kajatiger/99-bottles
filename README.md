# 99-bottles üçª

If you want to try the Sandi Metz problem yourself, either read the [book](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles) or clone the [exercise](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles_ruby) and try to make the tests pass.
By the way: there is really good non alcoholic beer out there. I recommend Lammsbr√§u.
